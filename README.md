# Purpose

The main purpose for this project is to teach myself various aspects
of programming. Because of this, this is a learners repository.

Things I would like to experiment with:
* Client / Server programming
* web programming
	* websockets
	* APIs
	* http/2
	* JWT
	* OAUTH2 (authz, authn)
* algorithms for maze genration
	* Bard's Tale like 40x40
	* Cave like

# Second Purpose

As the project's name already suggest, the way to achieve the above
mentioned goals is by programming a roguelike game. One of my favourite
game genres. Although I never finished nethack successfully, obviously.
