# Purpose

There are some things, they say, one should achieve in live, things like:

 * Plant an apple tree
 * Build a house
 * ...

This sounds familiar and old school? Let's translate this into a more
modern and simultaneously dated version:

 * Retrieve the Amulet of Yendor from the dephs of Gehenna!
 * Program your own roguelike game
 * Fail to beat that until you beat it

As the project's name already suggest, this repository serves the
second point of that achievement list. And maybe I'll get a better
understanding of nethack as well and beat it.
